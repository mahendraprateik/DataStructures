<h1> Problem 5: blockchain </h1>

<h2> Worst case time complexity is: O(n) </h2>

* Algorithm:
    * Append method: <b> O(1) </b>
        * It will work on a constant time since we have the tail of the linked list and we just need to append to that

    * Pop method: <b> O(n) </b>
        * Popping the tail would be done in linear time since we have to traverse through the list from the head

    * convert_to_list(): <b> O(n) </b>
        * Converting to list would be done in linear time since we have to traverse through the list from the head

    * Append would be done in constant time
