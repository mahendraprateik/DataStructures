Problem 5: blockchain

Worst case time complexity is: O(n)
    Algorithm:
        Append method: O(1)
        It will work on a constant time since we have the tail of the linked list and we just need to append to that

        Pop method: O(n)
        Popping the tail would be done in linear time since we have to traverse through the list from the head

        convert_to_list(): O(n)
        Converting to list would be done in linear time since we have to traverse through the list from the head

        Append would be done in constant time
