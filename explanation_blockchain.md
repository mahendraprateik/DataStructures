<h1> Problem 5: blockchain </h1>

<h2> Worst case time complexity is: O(n) </h2>

* Algorithm:
    * Append method: O(1)
        * It will work on a constant time since we have the tail of the linked list and we just need to append to that

    * Pop method: O(n)
        * Popping the tail would be done in linear time since we have to traverse through the list from the head

    * convert_to_list(): O(n)
        * Converting to list would be done in linear time since we have to traverse through the list from the head

    * Append would be done in constant time
