<h1> Problem 6: Union and Intersections </h1>

<h2> Worst case time complexity is: <b> O(n + m) </b> </h2>

* Algorithm:
    * Union(): <b> O(n + m) </b>
        * Traverses through first linked list in <b> O(n) </b>
        * Traverses through second linked list in <b> O(m) </b>
        * Loops through the union set to create a merged linked list in: <b> O(n + m) </b>
    * Intersection(): <b> O(n + m) </b>
        * Traverses through first linked list in <b> O(n) </b>
        * Traverses through second linked list in <b> O(m) </b>
        * Loops through the union set to create a merged linked list in: <b> O(n + m) </b>
