Problem 6: Union and Intersections

Worst case time complexity is: O(n + m)
    Algorithm:
        Union():
            Traverses through first linked list in O(n)
            Traverses through second linked list in O(m)
            Loops through the union set to create a merged linked list in: O(n + m)
        Intersection(): O(n + m)
            Traverses through first linked list in O(n)
            Traverses through second linked list in O(m)
            Loops through the union set to create a merged linked list in: O(n + m)
